We hope this site will help you better understand U.S. political campaign contributions. At this point we only have analysis up for the 2020 presidential election.

Check out the [node graph](/node-graph/) to see how money follows between committees and individuals and the [map](/map/) for understanding the geographical comparisons of political money.

If you want more information, there are a number of informative sites. Here are just a few:
